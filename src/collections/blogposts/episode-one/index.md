This is the episode in which I make a blog.

This website was made with [Astro](https://astro.build). I would've used raw HTML, CSS and JavaScript, but since I still
valued my sanity (and thinking about maintenance in the future), I decided not to.

[Pico](https://picocss.com/) is the CSS library. Fonts used are [Inter](https://fontsource.org/fonts/inter)
and [Source Code Pro](https://fontsource.org/fonts/source-code-pro). These are all delivered through [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com).
